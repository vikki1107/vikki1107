### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Vivek Limbavali. I am currently working in IBM as Technical/Customer Support Engineer. I am currently working on few of the cutting-edge technologies and concepts such as Blockchain, Docker, CouchDB. I am involved in design review, development and deployment of such tools and technologies in User Acceptance Test (UAT) and Production environment. I work directly with customers to maintain such codebase and any knowledge articles. I am also a Subject Matter Expert (SME) in IBM MQ with WebSpehere MQ Admin certification. I try to encourage the use of automation either by using standard automation tools or by developing python and shell scripts wherever possible. I consider myself a giver where I try to dump my knowledge onto my peers. 

I hold a Master of Science degree in Business Analytics and a Certification in Applied Statistics from California State University, Eastbay. I have completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Communication from Visvesvaraya Technological University, Karnataka, India.
